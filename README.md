Who's Heavier?

Uses an api to get NBA player weight data and has the user guess who is heavier.

Use of apis, flask, css styling, html

Finding an api and learning how to use it, using the updated variables, making the game continuous, making it look good

Noah Hulse and Enes Eroglu. Worked together as equals.

Use of api, functional game, website looks decent

api is very slow and crashes often because it is free. We could import all the api data into a file and make the game much faster and crash less. Could also make the website look better using things like jpegs or images.
